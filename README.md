Using Audrino with an ESP8266WiFi sensor, we can access the OC Transpo API to make a bus tracker.

# Board Requirements
For this project I used the following board and shelid;

| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| col 3 is      | right-aligned |
| col 2 is      | centered      | 
| zebra stripes | are neat      |
